# javascript-delegation
The purpose of this project is to demonstrate event delegation using Javascript.
Admittedly this is a simple exercise and there are a number of ways to do it.  Furthermore,
this also demonstrates how to create new elements and attach them to the DOM. I also used a
simple CSS transition for affect.

The user may enter a food or delete an existing food item.  If the 'add food' button is selected
without any food in the textfield, the user will receive a message.  Moreover, after each
submission the textfield box is cleared so the user cannot enter the same food twice by accident.

A live version of this can be seen at http://dpm65.com/jsdelegation
